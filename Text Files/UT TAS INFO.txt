****[FEEDBACK FOR WIP 2]****
holding up + right after falling down the hole in the beginning of ruins loses a frame (same for the 6 hole room)

if you hold down against the rock for another frame in the 1 rock room you don't get bumped backwards

you were also holding up + right into the toriel basement triggers. It doesn't lose time there, but on a lot of cutscenes that loses a frame, so be careful

you still lost a frame interacting with the box. Doing the thing you did on the save point (which is cool btw, I didn't know you could do that) doesn't work because holding up + right into the sign stops you from moving.

you can press x to close the box a frame earlier

(Changes RNG) save a frame on doggo by moving further to the right with x

you didn't release up after interacting with the switch in the tree for Geo strat, so you didn't move after interacting.

new Ice puzzle thing [https://youtu.be/W-av5ShHco8]

you also opened the menu too early for SGS. you can keep moving right for another frame or two if you do the menuing as fast as possible [won't change rng since you waited to open the text]

you can save 10 frames by grabbing the right seed first for petals 2

don't hold up right in the grass after spears 1, it loses a frame

you waited two frames to info the punch card for willy warp (the warp out of spears 2 room)

you also missed some wallclips in spears 2

scroll the screen down in the mad dummy cutscene, saves a ton of frames

you seem to have done all the wall clips in the mushroom maze that don't save time but not any of the ones in the lantern maze that do

didn't do undyne zigzag :frowning:

You didn't hold right when entering the room after spears 2, which loses a frame

you didn't oww off the SPCA'd monster kid text

do fixyflow chain vents (like this: https://youtu.be/Ml6jzjThEzE?t=53)

---WATERFALL MOLDSMAL BLCON MANIP---
GOAL: blcon alarm[4] = 15/20

I got 15/20 which is my goal, but since I manipped a frame it cancelled out the timesave

****[FEEDBACK FOR WIP 3]****
Still got the pushback on the one rock room

You can close the box a frame earlier (same frame as getting glove)

You can save a frame dodging the snowdecahedron by releasing right for a frame rather than pressing left

You opened the menu a frame early for SGS

Holding into the wall when getting on the ferry for spears 1 loses a frame

---RUINS TORIEL ATTACK MANIP---

---WATERFALL MOLDSMAL BLCON MANIP---
GOAL: blcon alarm[4] = 15/20 without a 1-frame manip.

No Manip - 15/20

LMFAO FIRST TRY

---WATERFALL SPEARS 2 TURNAROUND---
Bottom - 36070
Top - 36070

---WATERFALL UNDYNE ZIGZAG---
Got the zigzag

---HOTLAND VULKIN BLCON---
VULKIN BLCON GOAL: 15/20

CURRENT LOWEST BLCON VALUE: 15/20

ACHIEVED BY [INSERT THING LATER LMFAO]

---MAGMA CHAMBER STEP COUNT---
I got 130 but still got Fixyflow chain vents to work.

---TSUNDERPLANE BLCON VALUE---
TSUNDERPLANE BLCON GOAL: 15/20

CURRENT LOWEST BLCON VALUE: 15/20

ACHIEVED BY DOING A 1-FRAME DELAY AFTER ALL TEXT IS DRAWN AFTER EQUIPPING ITEM

****[FEEDBACK FOR WIP 5]****
You want to hold right at the end of the falling down cutscene. it moves you a pixel when you enter the trash room

Hard to tell, but make sure you're pressing z/enter on the first frame of the room for overflowing the save point and saving.

Scroll the screen during the mad dummy intro cutscene. You want to walk down to y = 300 and then back up to y = 225.

Since this is NG+, your death message isn't fixed. You want to manip for "Don't lose hope!"/"H! Stay determined..."

You want to get the temmie encounter while wallclipped, because being in the wall makes you move a frame sooner when closing the text.

It looks like you were late entering the transition for onedyne

The point of killing temmie instead of vulkin is that you don't have to hit the 3rd quad on undyne, you can do less damage and still get the cycle skip. 

At frame 45654 you may be able to save a frame by wall clipping. I think you can reach the vertical conveyor a frame sooner that way

cz'ing the elevator panel after menu recovery is faster than a normal overflow. you did a normal overflow after jetpack skip 

You also PCE slid upwards when overflowing the elevator instead of down.

Also you wanna release up after interacting with the elevator door before menu recovery, so you can move left/right on the frame after interacting.

You did 9 and 10 correctly after news skip, but you missed 11 on both menu recoveries.

****[STUFF FOR WIP 6]****
---WATERFALL MD GAMEOVER TEXT MANIP---
1 Frame Hahaha... Partial - "You're going to be alright!"
2 Frame Hahaha... Partial - "Our fate rests upon you..."
3 Frame Hahaha... Partial - "Don't lose hope!"

"Don't lose hope!" is the best, I went for that.

---WATERFALL UNDYNE FIGHT DAMAGE---
Resulting HP after 3 Undyne hits should be 1125 or less.

---WATERFALL UNDYNE PATTERN MANIP---
REQUIRED: PATTERN 3, PATTERN 6 OR PATTERN 9

NO DELAY [NO QUAD ATTACK 3] - PATTERN 3
1 FRAME PARTIAL [NO QUAD ATTACK 3] - PATTERN 7
1 FRAME ALL [NO QUAD ATTACK 3] - PATTERN 3

---WATERFALL UNDYNE CYCLE SKIP---
ASSUMING:
149/148 SECOND [149]
148/149 THIRD [148]

PERFECT

I NEED:
79 FIRST

PERFECT
